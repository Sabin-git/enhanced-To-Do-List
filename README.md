## Introduction

This is my first attempt at being a real software developer. I have done this project following a youtube tutorial, now I want to add a few features of my own.

## To-implement

-change mechanic for complete
    --remove complete boolean
    --add a button for complete task next to delete (for uncompleted tasks)
    --completed tasks will be crossed out to the bottom of the list
    --completed tasks only have the delete button available
-change mechanic for edit
    --when clicking on a task you'll see details of it
    --add a 'Edit' button, which edits the fiels
-add priority mechanic
    --low, medium, high priority
-add difficulty mechanic
    --hard, doable, easy
-add leaderboard
    --how many tasks completed
