## Introduction

I have done this project following a youtube tutorial, now I want to add a few features of my own.

## To-implement

   - remove complete boolean
   - add a button for complete task next to delete (for uncompleted tasks)
   - completed tasks will be crossed out to the bottom of the list
   - completed tasks only have the delete button available
- change mechanic for edit
   - when clicking on a task you'll see details of it
   - add a 'Edit' button, which edits the fiels
- add priority mechanic
   - low, medium, high priority
- add difficulty mechanic
   - hard, doable, easy
- add leaderboard
   - how many tasks completed
- hide completed tasks
   - put them in a separate url or hide/show within the main url
